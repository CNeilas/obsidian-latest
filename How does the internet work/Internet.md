Internet is a large network of computers that communicate all together.

You can link computers together with either an ethernet cable or Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.

If you need to connect a lot of computers, it gets complicated.

The problem is fixed by connecting the computers to a router. A router receives the file from computer A and forwards it to computer B while making sure that computer C doesn't get it.

If you want even more computers you can connect routers to each other and scale infinitely.

This is only a local network, to reach other networks like your friends or random people you need to connect to them, for that you need a modem into which the electricity/phone cables are connected.

We need to connect this to Internet Service Provider, which manages special routers that are linked together and can access other routers, then it sends the information from our network through the ISP networks and then to the destination.

To send a message you have to find the computer you want to send the message to.
All computers that are linked to a network have IP(Internet Protocol) addresses. It looks something like this `192.0.2.172`. We can't remember addresses like that very well so we use unique domain names put on top of IP addresses.

The Internet and Web are two different things, Web is just a service built on top of Internet.

Intranets are private networks restricted to members of a particular organization.
Extranets are similar to Intranets but they branch out to other organizations.
