```
<body>
	very many words wowoowowowowoo

	second line of many words
</body>
```

When text is put inside the body element, the space between them will not be seen, for that we have to use the `<p></p>` element. Like so:

```
<p>Very many words wowowoowoo</p> 

<p>Second line of many words</p>
```

With this the space between them will be seen.

## Headings

Headings are text that is larger and bolder, usually used for titles of content. `<h1></h1>`
is the biggest and most important one, it should only be used once. The sizes go down to
`<h6></h6>`

They look like this:

```
<h1>Big heading</h1>
<h2>Smaller heading</h2>
<h3>Smaller heading</h3>
<h4>Smaller heading</h4>
<h5>Smaller heading</h5>
<h6>Smallest heading</h6>
```

## Strong element

Makes text **Bold** and important for accessibility.

`<p>This word is <strong>strong</strong></p>`

## Em element

Makes text *italic* and puts emphasis on it for accessibility.

`<p>This word is <em>emphasized</em>`

## Comments in HTML

`<!-- This is a comment -->` This is just a not that does not affect the file whatsoever.

**P.S.** You can make new comments/comment lines with `ctrl + /`
